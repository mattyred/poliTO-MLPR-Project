The dataset consists of synthetic speaker embeddings that represent the acoustic characteristics of a spoken utterance. Each row corresponds to a different speaker, and contains 12 features followed by the gender label (1 for female, 0 for male). The features do not have any particular interpretation. Speakers belong to four different age groups. The age information, however, is not available.

The training set consists of 3000 samples per class, whereas the test set contains 2000 samples per class.
